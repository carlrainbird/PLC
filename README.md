# PLC
There are many commercial PLC development packages. This is a PLC type programme. The standard for PLC’s, IEC-61131. The software is not to be restricted by this standard, although it will be difficult not to implement many of the elements of a tried and tested standard. I think a better approach would be the standard plus more.
Out of the standards five languages I find ladder logic to be the most useful the other parts of the language in my humble opinion are narrow and service the automation world, although I have worked on some very complicated control sytems that implement proper control algorithms usually test in matlab or some other type of simulation package. The irony of it is that control engineers in the automation world are not overly familiar to such control sytems.
The biggest fault I find with PLC’s is ability to make a super mess of working software. I have some ideas why but I think my ideas are way to opinionated, having worked in the industry for many years.
I have chosen rust for this out of the blocks programme.
I kinda like the detail given to safe code it just makes good sense to get it right from the start.
Design patterns are the order of the day...tring to keep away from the invented here syndrome.
